# FourierSpaces.jl

Goals
- [ ] Transformation-based spaces
    - [X] Fourier space
    - [ ] Sine space
    - [ ] Cosine space
    - [ ] Chevyshev transform space??
- [ ] Separate out FFT library compilation via requires or something
- [ ] make it more general so any transform-based PDE solver can use preexisting abstractions
